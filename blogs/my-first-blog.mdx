shortTheme: 'When someone likes to write or blog about something,opting the topics he or she likes,he should elucidate the chosen topic with a complete clarity and also cover all the domains for which he talks about.Blogging has always been a hobby of mine.It gives an intense pleasure,like someone is a wanderlust,when I write about something I know.Although,I never had blogged,I always had a willingness to blog through my own website sharing my knowledge.I wish this post may be the inception.'

Startingly,I have started to blog through my website from now on.Blogging has always been my passion.It helps every individual ameliorate their thinking capability:makes them become more creative and innovative.On the other hand,there is profound increase in the use of internet over the past few years,in the context of Nepal.Many people have had consumed the internet,so enormously that they even forget to perform their fundamental activities like sleeping,eating,drinking,exercising,etc, nowadays.Many of the reports has claimed,especially to those who are in their teens,that the use of internet is so emerging sufficient enough to become the victims of far-sightedness,brain hammerage,suicidal activities,and more prominently the introversion.Had they flagged the use of internet,they wouldn't have had such bad consequences.It also has the good aspects such as you can earn money with blogging some quality content,creating with indigenous flavour.

Since, this is my first post my mind is stuffed with a blank space and I'm feeling obscure about what to write.Obviously, this doesn't secure my contentment about how write but of course, it will strive me to post consistently on a day to day basis.I wish this actually helps me to improve my thinking and cognitive abilities.Every new day,a new topic and many more exotic vocabularies will sure make me emerge from predicament:make me feel more pleasant.

This much makes a happy ending for today;nonetheless,continuation will be followed.
