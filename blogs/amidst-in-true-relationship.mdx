Let me share my thoughts on this relationship kind of things.

<br />

I've always been captivated by the 1999 movie **Titanic**, where the essence of real love is portrayed with such depth
and beauty. The story of Jack and Rose falling in love unconditionally is a testament to how profound and selfless love
can be. Both characters are willing to sacrifice their lives for one another without a moment's hesitation, highlighting
the purity and intensity of their bond.

<br />

For a relationship to last eternally, it needs a foundation of respect, care, love, time, and attention.
These elements are crucial. If even one of these aspects is missing, it can cause one partner to feel
unfulfilled and unhappy. This dissatisfaction often leads to seeking what’s missing in third person, which is a
common reason for breakups and separations. It’s obvious that no one wants to stay in a relationship where they
feel neglected or uncared for.

<br />

Quarrels and arguments are inevitable in any relationship, but they don’t have to signal the end. The key is
communication—sharing the things that upset us and working together to resolve them. This open dialogue acts as a
healing medicine, strengthening the relationship and helping it to endure through challenges.

<br />

I am writing something, now, that whoever reads this blog must know and acknowledge from the start, if by any chance, they chose
to start a real and long lasting relationship kind of things.Here I go.

<br />

The right one will love you.Finding someone who genuinely cares about you and your well-being is extremely hard to find this
day and age.Time and time again I hear about someone walking away because things became **"too hard"**.You deserve someone
who fights for you when things get difficult, and they aren't gonna be like "you know what? it's over" and throw everything
away.If that person really values you, there's no such thing as you being **"too complicated"**.There's no such thing as you
being **"too crazy"**.There's no such thing as you being **"too crazy"**.There's no such thing as you being **"too much"**.

<br />

The right person will love you unconditionally and they will be willing to make it work, despite what the obstacle is and
whatever the problem may be, because losing you is never an option.No **ARGUMENT** is going to push them away far enough, no
**FIGHT** is going to cause them to lose feelings, and no **DISAGREEMENT** is going to make them drift away from you.No matter
how bad things get, they would never let it outweigh how much he or she cares about you.No matter how **DYSFUNCTIONAL** things
become, they would never let it take away the value of your relationship with them.

<br />

Therefore, my suggestion is:

- Fall in love with someone who can't go a single day without talking to you.

- Who understands you even in your madness, someone who is patient with you and are guided by morals and reasoning.

- Someone who supports you even on your darkest days and always picks you up when you're at your lowest.

- Fall in love with someone who talks with you in depth about their feelings and what has molded them to become the person that they are today.

<br />
**Take my advice and remember**.

person who truly values you, would never put themselves in a position to lose you.'_
