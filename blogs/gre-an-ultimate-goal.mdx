shortTheme: 'It has been mundane for every Nepalese engineers taking GRE,for the past few decades.Although,those grueling and convoluted long years of bachelors in engineering,there are not many becoming job opportunities available for newly graduated engineers.Therefore,they happen to aboard to USA preparing and competing GRE.'

Nepal,located in South Asia,is a developing and emerging country.As being a developing nation,provision and competence for normal people is arduous;so are the bureaucratic policies.The governmental activities are so tedious and convoluted here that one has to offer bribes even for elliciting the driving license application form.Everywhere,almost everywhere, the representatives,executives, and the concerned authorities for the particular department are flagging the emerging process rather than ameliorating them.They are tantalizing all Nepali citizens by deceiving delusions.Clearly,if this process goes hanging on and on;no Nepalese will get contentment.

<br/>
Engineers are the backbones and pillars,of every developing as well as developed nation.No engineers are here for the eradication of development.Development should not be transitory rather it should be sustainable.Since,the educational system in Nepal works in a haphazard fashion,many of the institutions aren't acquired with the sterling education.Consequently,those who don't prepare for furthur study in abroad are outnumbered by those who does:the consequences of rare job opporunities and poor quality education.Had there been immoderate job opportunties,they wouldn't have prepared for abroad.This would have aggregated the young and vigorous engineers in the nation and helped reached the apex of development roadmap.

<br/>
Let's get cogent about the relation between,this ironical pheneomenon,GRE––Graduate Record Examination––and USA.GRE,a test,conducted by ETS––Educational Training Service––which helps studens ellicit the scholarship worth around 1.5 crore(U.S$100,000)––tentative.It contains three sections:Verbal Reasoning––English section––,Quantitative Reasoning ––Mathematics section––each of which carries 170 points,and an Analytical Writing diverged into two sections,the argument writing and issue writing,6 points each.This makes the GRE test accumulated with a total of 340 points.The analytical section's score isn't added to the total score as it should be submitted along with the former two sections while applying in unversities of your choice.In addition,it is a computer adaptive test where the examination pattern appears in the following two ways.
<br/>

* Writing––Verbal––Quantitative––Verbal––Quantitative––Verbal
* Writing––Quantitative––Verbal––Quantitative––Verbal––Quantitative

<br/>
It is mandatory for the students,especially of the STEM background,taking GRE test to score minimum of 307 to get a fully funded scholarship for masters and phD program in mid-level universities of USA.I have listed some of the universities along with their ranks and palatable GRE scores below.Whilst,preparing for the GRE is a grueling and demanding task,many have scored a good score despite its difficulties and hindrances.This suggests that in order to prevail,one must be an avid reader,listener and more importantly possess good cognitive power and intelligence.Futhermore, concerning about USA,there might be a question about why USA?Aren't there any choices for more scholarships without having to take GRE.Yes, there is but is far less probable because of the fact that it's like winning a lottery.I'm sure you understood what I mean to say.USA, has about 1800+ universities:it implies that you've got many options to apply for, even if you got rejected by some.The advantage of excelling masters ,in your field of interest,in USA is that you get to work in the same field of which you studied after completion.This is because job opportunities are prevalent in USA than in other countries.After the completion of your masters or phD,you should get an approbation for OPT––abbreviated as Optional Practical Training for certain period of time interval (at most 27 months for STEM background students)––to work in the field of your interest.

<br/>
Many students take classes––physical or online to get prepared for the test.This seems compelling as the test itself is arduous and convoluted.As far as I know, gregmat is the best site to prepare for the test if you are planning to take online classes.But my suggestion,if any available,is that it will be better to take the physical classes.Collins,located in Putalisadak,Kathmandu,Nepal,a renowned and popular institution for GRE test preparation,is a perfect opt if you're confound about choosing the right test preparation center.There will be a two month physical classes guiding you through different tactics to apply while tackling different hurdles that may arise while facing the real examination.Henceforth,there will be weekend mock tests every saturday after the course completion,which will help you increase your point.No doubt in their explanations and clarifications of the problems that makes you befogged.After you take the final test other than the simulated ones,you must give TOEFL/IELTS test opting any of the both which you like.

<br/>
Hitherto,you might have curiosity about the most favorable time to apply for the universities in USA? If you are planning to apply for fall (August) intake,then application should be submitted before January;if it is for spring (January) intake then you must submit it before August.Approbation for your application and elliciting such a huge amount of scholarship is of course a long and knotty process.You must have the guts to keep patience to prevent yourself from getting invaded by depression and anxiety sufferings.Startling is that there is a record where 290 score in GRE is awarded with a fully funded scholarship.Fully funded means tuition fees + living expenses.For example, if the cost of tuition fees for Master's degree in Computer Science is $100,000 then additional 15,000 yearly is given as an accomodation expenses for a two year course.Hence, one must be an assiduous and must possess a not relinquishing feeling in order to prevail his/her journey to USA.To become an eminent alumni of the american university and acquire its degree;you should pledge yourself a commitment that you must do it.It's not a joke though it's a serious and significant matter about ones career.

**Note:**&nbsp;Hitherto,I guess you may be concerned for what positions students are applying to? The answer is,one can apply for the positions like Teaching Assistant and Reasearch Assitant.May be there are other positions as well,but as far as I know these are commonplace.Also, there are many other universities too,high ranked and low ranked, other than the above mentioned ones that accept sporadic GRE scores.
